# Privity - Share Booking System PRD

## Original Problem Statement
Build a Share Booking System for managing client share bookings, inventory tracking, and P&L reports with role-based access control.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React.js with Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI components, Recharts
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) with async MongoDB (modular router architecture)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based permissions
- **Theme**: Light/Dark mode with ThemeContext, iOS-style design

## User Personas
1. **PE Desk (Role 1)**: Full system access + User Management + Deletion rights
2. **PE Manager (Role 2)**: PE Desk without delete/DB restore rights + Vendor access (no delete)
3. **Zonal Manager (Role 3)**: Manage users, clients, stocks, bookings, reports
4. **Manager (Role 4)**: Manage own clients, bookings, view reports
5. **Employee (Role 5)**: Create bookings, view clients
6. **Viewer (Role 6)**: Read-only access
7. **Finance (Role 7)**: Employee rights + Full Finance page access (payments, refunds, RP payments)
8. **Business Partner (Role 8)**: External partners with OTP login, can create bookings, view own dashboard
9. **Partners Desk (Role 9)**: Employee rights + BP management (no delete rights)

## Core Requirements (Static)
- User authentication (register/login)
- Client management (CRUD + bulk upload + portfolio view)
- Vendor management for stock suppliers
- Stock management (CRUD + bulk upload)
- Purchase tracking from vendors
- Inventory management with weighted average pricing
- Booking management with inventory validation
- P&L reporting with filtering and export
- Referral Partner management and commission tracking
- Business Partner management and revenue sharing

## What's Been Implemented

### Latest Updates (Feb 03, 2026)

#### ✅ Feature Enhancements - COMPLETED (Feb 03, 2026)

**1. Refresh Booking Status Button**
- Added `POST /api/bookings/{booking_id}/refresh-status` endpoint
- Checks if all payments are done → updates payment_status to 'paid'
- Checks if client approval is pending and 1st payment made → auto-approves client
- Updates DP status to 'ready' when booking approved and fully paid
- Added refresh button (🔄) in Bookings page action column

**2. Client Employee Mapping Fix**
- Fixed race condition in Clients.js where employee list wasn't loading
- Employee mapping dropdown now shows all employees correctly

**3. Referral Partner Mapping Update (UI + Backend) - COMPLETED**
- Added `PUT /api/bookings/{booking_id}/referral-partner` endpoint (backend)
- Added "Edit RP" button (Users icon, purple) in Bookings action column (frontend)
- Added "Edit Referral Partner Mapping" dialog with:
  - Booking info display (booking number, client, stock, current RP)
  - RP dropdown with "Remove RP Assignment" option and list of approved RPs
  - Revenue Share % input (capped at 30%, appears when RP selected)
  - Employee share calculation display
  - Update RP Mapping button
- Only allowed before stock transfer is completed
- Only visible for PE Level users
- Not shown for BP bookings, transferred bookings, or voided bookings
- Creates audit log for RP changes (BOOKING_RP_UPDATE action)

**4. Default Referral Partner Assignment**
- When creating a booking, if no RP is selected, system auto-assigns the creator's linked RP (if any)
- Default revenue share is 30%

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/routers/bookings.py` - Added refresh-status and referral-partner endpoints, auto-assign creator's RP
- `frontend/src/pages/Bookings.js` - Added refresh button, Edit RP button, RP Mapping dialog
- `frontend/src/pages/Clients.js` - Fixed useEffect to wait for user data

#### ✅ PE Desk Menu Access Fix - COMPLETED (Feb 03, 2026)
**Bug**: PE Desk was being redirected away from protected pages (Audit Trail, Email Server, Vendors, DP Receivables, DP Transfer, Business Partners, etc.) due to a race condition where permission checks ran before user data loaded.

**Root Cause**: The `useEffect` hooks in multiple pages checked `isPELevel` or `isPEDesk` permissions before the user data was loaded from localStorage, causing false redirects.

**Fix Applied**: Updated 15 frontend pages to wait for user data to load before checking permissions:
- Added `user` to useCurrentUser destructuring
- Added `if (user === null) return;` check before permission validation
- Updated useEffect dependencies to include `user`

**Pages Fixed**:
1. AuditTrail.js
2. EmailServerConfig.js
3. Analytics.js
4. ContractNotes.js
5. EmailLogs.js
6. EmailTemplates.js
7. PEDashboard.js
8. Purchases.js
9. BulkUpload.js
10. CompanyMaster.js
11. SecurityDashboard.js
12. BusinessPartners.js
13. DPReceivables.js
14. DPTransferClient.js
15. Vendors.js

**Test Results**: 30/30 menu pages accessible to PE Desk ✅

- PE Desk (role 1 with wildcard `*` permission) can access ALL endpoints
- Viewer (role 4 with limited permissions) correctly denied write/admin operations
- Error messages are descriptive: "Permission denied. Viewer role does not have permission to..."

**Architecture Benefits**:
1. Roles created in Role Management UI are now properly connected to backend authorization
2. Single source of truth for permissions in `permission_service.py`
3. Flexible permission expansion with wildcards (`*`, `category.*`)
4. No breaking changes - existing functionality preserved

#### ✅ Dynamic Permission Integration - All Routers Migrated - COMPLETED (Feb 03, 2026)

**Note**: Documents must be uploaded in Company Master settings for them to be attached.

#### ✅ Payment Recording Bug Fix - COMPLETED (Feb 02, 2026)
**Bug**: Clicking the "Pay" button in the Bookings page caused the page to go blank.
**Root Cause**: Backend endpoint `POST /api/bookings/{booking_id}/payments` expected Query parameters (amount, payment_mode, etc.) but the frontend was sending a JSON body.
**Fix**:
- Created `PaymentRecordRequest` Pydantic model in `backend/routers/bookings.py` (line ~1357)
- Modified `add_payment_tranche` endpoint to accept `payment_data: PaymentRecordRequest` as JSON body
- Added support for `payment_date`, `proof_url` fields
- Enhanced response to include `dp_transfer_ready` status
**Testing**: 100% pass rate - Payment dialog opens correctly, form submission works, toast confirmation shows success.

#### ✅ Payment Status Updates Fix - COMPLETED (Feb 02, 2026)
**Bug 1**: After full payment, "DP Ready" badge was not showing
**Bug 2**: After first payment, "Client Accepted" status was not showing
**Root Cause**: 
- Backend was setting `dp_status = "ready"` but frontend checks `dp_transfer_ready`
- First payment wasn't automatically updating `client_confirmation_status`
**Fix**:
- Modified `add_payment_tranche` endpoint in `backend/routers/bookings.py`:
  - Sets `client_confirmation_status = "accepted"` on first payment
  - Sets both `dp_status = "ready"` AND `dp_transfer_ready = True` on full payment
- Updated `BookingWithDetails` model in `backend/models/__init__.py` to include:
  - `payment_complete: bool`
  - `dp_status: Optional[str]`
  - `dp_ready_at: Optional[str]`
**Testing**: Verified via screenshot - "Client Accepted" and "DP Ready" badges display correctly.

#### ✅ Payment Delete Feature for PE Desk/Manager - COMPLETED (Feb 02, 2026)
**Feature**: Allow PE Desk and PE Manager to delete payment entries from bookings
**Implementation**:
- Backend: Updated `DELETE /api/bookings/{booking_id}/payments/{tranche_number}` endpoint in `backend/routers/bookings.py`
  - Changed from `is_pe_desk_only` to `is_pe_level` to allow both PE Desk (role 1) and PE Manager (role 2)
  - Added logic to reset `client_confirmation_status` to "pending" when all payments are deleted
  - Added logic to reset `dp_transfer_ready` and `dp_status` when payment is no longer complete
- Frontend: Updated payment dialog in `frontend/src/pages/Bookings.js`
  - Added `handleDeletePayment` function with confirmation dialog
  - Added red trash icon button next to each payment in Payment History (visible only to PE Level users)
  - Refreshes booking data after successful deletion
**Testing**: Verified via curl and screenshot - Delete buttons visible, deletion works correctly.

#### ✅ Centralized Role Utility - COMPLETED (Feb 02, 2026)
**Feature**: Create a single, shared utility for role checks across the frontend
**Implementation**:
- **Created `/app/frontend/src/utils/roles.js`**:
  - Role constants: `ROLE_IDS`, `ROLE_NAMES`
  - Role check functions: `isPELevel()`, `isPEDesk()`, `isPEManager()`, `isFinance()`, `isViewer()`, `isPartnersDesk()`, `isBusinessPartner()`, `isEmployee()`
  - Permission check functions: `canRecordPayments()`, `canDeletePayments()`, `canApproveBookings()`, `canEditLandingPrice()`, `canManageUsers()`, `canDelete()`, `canModify()`, `canDownload()`, `hasFinanceAccess()`, `canManageBusinessPartners()`, `canViewAllBookings()`
  - Helper: `getUserRoleFlags()` returns all role flags in one object
- **Enhanced `/app/frontend/src/hooks/useCurrentUser.js`**:
  - Integrated with centralized roles utility
  - Returns all role and permission flags
  - Listens for storage changes (login/logout in other tabs)
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing code
- **Updated key pages to use centralized utility**:
  - `Bookings.js` - Now uses `useCurrentUser()` hook
  - `Clients.js` - Now uses `useCurrentUser()` hook
  - `Dashboard.js` - Now uses `useCurrentUser()` hook
  - `Finance.js` - Now uses `useCurrentUser()` hook
**Benefits**:
- Single source of truth for role definitions (synced with backend/config.py)
- Prevents hardcoded role IDs scattered across components
- Easy to add new roles or permissions
- Consistent role checking across the application
**Usage Example**:
```javascript
import { useCurrentUser } from '../hooks/useCurrentUser';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { isPELevel, canApproveBookings, isViewer } = useCurrentUser();
  
  if (isViewer) return <ReadOnlyView />;
  if (canApproveBookings) return <ApproveButton />;
};

- Moved all business logic to modular routers under `/routers/`
- Server.py now only contains: app initialization, startup/shutdown events, WebSocket endpoint, router registration, static files mount, CORS middleware
- **21 modular routers** handling all endpoints: auth, users, clients, referral_partners, business_partners, stocks, inventory, purchases, bookings, finance, reports, analytics, dashboard, audit_logs, email_logs, email_templates, smtp_config, company_master, database_backup, contract_notes, bulk_upload, notifications

#### ✅ Company Master Logo & Document View Fix - COMPLETED (Jan 30, 2026)
**⚠️ CRITICAL FIX - DO NOT MODIFY**
**File**: `/app/frontend/src/pages/CompanyMaster.js`

**Bug 1: Logo Not Showing After Update**
- **Root Cause**: Browser caching prevented new logo from displaying
- **Fix**: Added `logoKey` state with cache-busting query parameter
- **Critical Code**:
  ```javascript
  const [logoKey, setLogoKey] = useState(Date.now());
  // On upload success:
  setLogoKey(Date.now());
  // In img tag:
  <img key={logoKey} src={`${getFullUrl(logoUrl)}?t=${logoKey}`} />
  ```

**Bug 2: Document View Returns Blank Screen**
- **Root Cause**: View button used relative URL instead of full API URL
- **Fix**: Added `getFullUrl()` helper function
- **Critical Code**:
  ```javascript
  const getFullUrl = (url) => {
    if (!url) return null;
    if (url.startsWith('http')) return url;
    return `${process.env.REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL}/api${url}`;
  };
  ```

**⚠️ WARNING**: Do not remove or modify `logoKey`, `getFullUrl()`, or the cache-busting logic. These fixes are critical for proper file display.

#### ✅ Multi-Level User Hierarchy System - COMPLETED (Feb 2, 2026)
**Implementation Details:**
- **Purpose**: Implement organizational hierarchy (Employee → Manager → Zonal Head → Regional Manager → Business Head) to control data visibility. Higher levels can view data of all subordinates but can only edit their own.
- **Backend Service** (`/app/backend/services/hierarchy_service.py`):
  - `get_all_subordinates(manager_id)` - Recursively get all direct/indirect reports
  - `get_team_user_ids(user_id)` - Get user + all subordinates for filtering
  - `can_view_user_data(viewer_id, target_id)` - Check view permission
  - `can_edit_user_data(editor_id, target_id)` - Check edit permission (self or PE only)
  - `get_team_clients_query(user_id)` - MongoDB query for hierarchy-filtered clients
  - `get_team_bookings_query(user_id)` - MongoDB query for hierarchy-filtered bookings
  - `get_manager_chain(user_id)` - Get all managers up the chain (for circular reference prevention)
- **Backend Endpoints** (`/app/backend/routers/users.py`):
  - `GET /api/users/hierarchy` - Returns all users with hierarchy info
  - `PUT /api/users/{user_id}/hierarchy` - Update hierarchy_level and reports_to
  - `GET /api/users/hierarchy/levels` - Returns 5 hierarchy levels
  - `GET /api/users/hierarchy/potential-managers` - Users who can be managers
  - `GET /api/users/team/subordinates` - Current user's subordinates
  - `GET /api/users/team/direct-reports` - Users directly reporting to current user
- **Data Filtering**:
  - `/api/clients` now filters based on hierarchy (line 200-232)
  - `/api/bookings` now filters based on hierarchy (line 393+)
  - Employee: Sees only their own clients/bookings
  - Manager+: Sees self + all subordinates' data
  - PE Level: Sees all data
- **Frontend UI** (`/app/frontend/src/pages/UserManagement.js`):
  - "All Users" tab: Shows Hierarchy Level and Reports To columns
  - "Team Hierarchy" tab: Visual organization structure
  - Hierarchy Management dialog: Set hierarchy_level and reports_to
  - Blue Users icon button to manage hierarchy
- **Bug Fixed**: Added circular reference prevention in `PUT /api/users/{user_id}/hierarchy`
  - Uses `get_manager_chain()` to detect if assignment would create a loop
  - Returns error: "Cannot assign this manager - it would create a circular reporting structure"
- **Testing**: 100% backend + frontend pass rate (iteration_47)

**Hierarchy Levels:**
| Level | Name             |
|-------|------------------|
| 1     | Employee         |
| 2     | Manager          |
| 3     | Zonal Head       |
| 4     | Regional Manager |
| 5     | Business Head    |

**User Model Fields:**
- `hierarchy_level` (int): 1-5, defaults to 1 (Employee)
- `reports_to` (string): User ID of the manager

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/backend/services/hierarchy_service.py` - Core hierarchy logic
- `/app/backend/routers/users.py` - Hierarchy endpoints + circular reference fix
- `/app/backend/routers/clients.py` - Hierarchy-based filtering
- `/app/backend/routers/bookings.py` - Hierarchy-based filtering
- `/app/backend/models/__init__.py` - User model with hierarchy fields
