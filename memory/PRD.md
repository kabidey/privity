# Privity - Share Booking System PRD

## Original Problem Statement
Build a Share Booking System for managing client share bookings, inventory tracking, and P&L reports with role-based access control.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React.js with Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI components, Recharts
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) with async MongoDB
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based permissions

## User Personas
1. **PE Desk (Role 1)**: Full system access + User Management
2. **Zonal Manager (Role 2)**: Manage users, clients, stocks, bookings, reports
3. **Manager (Role 3)**: Manage own clients, bookings, view reports
4. **Employee (Role 4)**: Create bookings, view clients
5. **Viewer (Role 5)**: Read-only access

## Core Requirements (Static)
- User authentication (register/login)
- Client management (CRUD + bulk upload + portfolio view)
- Vendor management for stock suppliers
- Stock management (CRUD + bulk upload)
- Purchase tracking from vendors
- Inventory management with weighted average pricing
- Booking management with inventory validation
